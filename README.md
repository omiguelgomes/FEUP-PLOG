## The game
Mapello is a board game based on Reversi designed by Simon M. Lucas. The objective is to have the highest ammount of pieces of the same colour (the one player chose) when there's no longer any valid move available.

## The pieces
 - White piece
 - Black piece
 - Walls: They act like normal walls (same as the outer part of the board)
 - Bonuses: They count an extra points when captured
 - Jokers: They act as normal pieces of the player in turn


## Setup
The players can choose between playing an original board setup or create their own by choosing where the walls, bonuses and jokers go.

Note that only jokers can be put in the outer part of the board.
